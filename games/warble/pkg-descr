Warble is a native Linux word-guessing game built in Vala and Gtk for
elementary OS.

Figure out the word before your guesses run out!

- Three difficulty levels
- Almost 5k possible answers
- Need a break? Close the game and automatically pick back up where
  you left off

Warble is inspired by (and not affiliated with) the recently popular
online game Wordle (which itself is reminiscent of the late 80's game
show Lingo).
