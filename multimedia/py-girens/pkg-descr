Girens is a Plex media player client. You can watch and listen to your
music, shows and movies with this GTK app.

There are more Plex clients that can be used on Linux. For example the
Plex website and the Plex media Player. Those Plex clients are lacking
functions which I like to have. For example: a responsive layout (so
you can use it on a small screen), function to download media items to
the device and GTK+ is awesome.
