Unofficial Python bindings for the Plex API. Our goal is to match all
capabilities of the official Plex Web Client. A few of the many
features we currently support are:

- Navigate local or remote shared libraries.
- Perform library actions such as scan, analyze, empty trash.
- Remote control and play media on connected clients.
- Listen in on all Plex Server notifications.
