Most web browsers have a Headless Mode, which is a way to run them
without displaying any graphical interface. Headless mode is mainly
used for automated testing but also comes in handy if you want to take
screenshots of web pages that are exact replicas of what you would see
on your screen if you were using the browser yourself.

However, for the sake of taking screenshots, headless mode is not very
convenient to use. HTML2Image aims to hide the inconveniences of the
browsers' headless modes while adding useful features, such as
allowing the creation of images from simple strings.
