xcape allows you to use a modifier key as another key when pressed and
released on its own. Note that it is slightly slower than pressing the
original key, because the pressed event does not occur until the key
is released. The default behaviour is to generate the Escape key when
Left Control is pressed and released on its own. (If you don't
understand why anybody would want this, I'm guessing that Vim is not
your favourite text editor ;)
